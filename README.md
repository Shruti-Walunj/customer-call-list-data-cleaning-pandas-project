# 📊  Customer Call List  Data Cleaning Using Pandas

# 📝 Description:
Cleaned and prepared a raw Excel dataset containing customer contact details using Python and Pandas. The goal was to transform messy data into a reliable format for outreach, ensuring clean phone numbers, accurate names, structured addresses, and removal of non-contactable leads.

# 🛠️ Key Tasks:
Removed duplicate records and dropped irrelevant columns

Standardized inconsistent last names and reformatted messy phone numbers to XXX-XXX-XXXX

Split full addresses into separate fields: Street, State, and Zip Code

Normalized “Paying Customer” and “Do Not Contact” fields into binary ‘Y/N’ format

Filtered out customers who opted not to be contacted and entries with missing phone numbers

Handled null values and reset the index for a clean DataFrame

# 📊Insights:
The final cleaned dataset was accurate, structured, and ready for operational use. All contacts had valid phone numbers, cleaned names, consistent field values, and clear contact eligibility. The cleaned data can now be directly integrated into CRM tools or used for marketing call campaigns.
